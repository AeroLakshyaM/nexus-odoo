#  Nexus – Skill Swap Platform

## Problem Statement: Skill Swap

The Skill Swap Platform aims to create a collaborative online ecosystem where individuals can exchange skills with one another. Users can offer their own expertise in a specific area while seeking mentorship or guidance in another skill, fostering a community-driven model of peer-to-peer learning.

- Offer skills they are proficient in.
- Find and connect with peers offering skills they want to learn.
- Swap skills in a barter-like system without monetary transactions.
- Track learning progress and provide mutual feedback.
